\usage{
generateBatchDataLogPoisson(
  N,
  P,
  group_rates,
  batch_rates,
  group_weights,
  batch_weights,
  frac_known = 0.2,
  permute_variables = TRUE,
  scale_data = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of items (rows) to generate.}

\item{P}{The number of columns in the generated dataset.}

\item{group_rates}{A vector of the group rates for the classes within a column.}

\item{batch_rates}{A vector of the batch rates for the classes within a column.
This is used to create a variable which has the sum of the appropriate batch
and class rate, it might be better interpreted as the batch effect on the
observed rate.}

\item{group_weights}{One of either a K x B matrix of the expected proportion
of each batch in each group or a K-vector of the expected proportion of the
entire dataset in each group.}

\item{batch_weights}{A vector of the expected proportion of N in each batch.}

\item{frac_known}{The number of items with known labels.}

\item{permute_variables}{Logical indicating if group and batch means and
standard deviations should be permuted in each column or not (defaults to
``TRUE``).}

\item{scale_data}{Logical indicating if data should be mean centred and
standardised (defaults to ``FALSE``).}
}
\value{
A list of 5 objects; the data generated from the groups with and
without batch effects, the label indicating the generating group, the
batch label and the vector indicating training versus test.
}
\description{
Generate data from K multivaraite normal or multivariate t
distributions with additional noise from batches. Assumes independence across
columns. In each column the parameters are randomly permuted for both the
groups and batches.
