#' @title Check proposal windows
#' @description Checks the proposal windows are acceptable.
#' @param mu_proposal_window The proposal window for the cluster mean proposal
#' kernel. The proposal density is a Gaussian distribution, the window is the
#' variance.
#' @param cov_proposal_window The proposal window for the cluster covariance
#' proposal kernel. The proposal density is a Wishart distribution, this
#' argument is the reciprocal of the degree of freedom.
#' @param m_proposal_window The proposal window for the batch mean proposal
#'  kernel. The proposal density is a Gaussian distribution, the window is the
#' variance.
#' @param S_proposal_window The proposal window for the batch standard deviation
#'  proposal kernel. The proposal density is a Gamma distribution, this
#' argument is the reciprocal of the rate.
#' @param t_df_proposal_window The proposal window for the degrees of freedom
#' for the multivariate t distribution (not used if type is not 'MVT'). The
#' proposal density is a Gamma distribution, this argument is the reciprocal of
#' the rate.
#' @param verbose Logical indicating if a warning should be printed if proposal
#' windows are outside their expected scale.
#' @return No return value, called for side effects
#' @examples
